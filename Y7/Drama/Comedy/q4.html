    <h2>Satire</h2>
    <p>Satire is a literary technique that uses irony, exaggeration, humour and sarcasm to insult and expose flaws and
        inferior traits of individuals, or even societies as a whole. It often aims to provoke and effect change through
        humour.
    </p>
    <h2>Slapstick</h2>
    <p>Slapstick is a form of comedy typically involving the use of exaggerated physicality, ebullient actions and
        ridiculous situations to provoke laughter through bodily humour and physical mishaps. It leans more towards
        acting physically and visually rather than wit or dialogue.
    </p>
    <h2>Overstatement:</h2>
    <p>Also known as hyperbole, this involves exaggeration in emotions, actions or circumstances that would not be
        considered realistic up on the stage. This increases the intensity of the scene to get a solid reaction from the
        audience.
    </p>
    <h2>Understatement:</h2>
    <p>This involves portraying emotions or actions in a hushed, restrained manner to possibly put to effect tension and
        subtlety. For example, if a character is extremely happy, they may just say, “Cool,” as an understatement.
    </p>
    <h2>Parody</h2>
    <p>This element involves warping parts of the original work to create humour or criticising an original work itself.
        In short, it is a humorous or mocking imitation of something.
    </p>
    <h2>Imitation</h2>
    <p>Imitation can involve actors using certain character traits such as the accents, speaking patterns and
        behavioural patterns to bring action up onto the stage. This form of drama also provokes the audience to let go
        of their doubts or disbelief and allow themselves to be fully preoccupied in the world of acting.
    </p>
    <h2>Body language</h2>
    <p>Body language is the art of using facial expressions and body movement to convey certain emotions such as
        happiness, sadness, frustrated ness etc. Some stances may show a sense of confidence, possibly even with music
        in the background to press the point further. Every subtle detail gives the audience a deeper understanding and
        connection to the characters. This is a powerful tool that brings characters to life and engages the audience on
        an emotional level.
