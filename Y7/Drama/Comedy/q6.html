    <h2>Inside the NBA</h2>
    <p>This photo from a TV show appeals to my sense of humour because I like watching NBA and this is a retired NBA
        player with many jokes. Shaq is 216 centimetres tall and this genetically would give most people large hands.
        This normal sized water bottle that us average humans could barely wrap our hands around is just like a jelly
        bean to Shaq. </p>
