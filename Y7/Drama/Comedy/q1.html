        <p>Greek theatre first made its way into the world of entertainment between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE. It laid the structure for lots of Western drama and theatrical conventions. Here are some facts about Greek theatre:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Greek theatre was formed from religious celebrations worshipping Dionysus, also known as the god of wine, fertility and ecstacy. The earliest forms of Greek theatre were these parts of the festivals.</li>
            <li>The Greeks built colossal al fresco ampitheatres for their drama. The most famous one was the “Theatre of Dionysus” in Athens, which can host approximately 170,000 at once.</li>
            <li>Greek actors would wear masks to represent their characteristics and emotions. As well as to magnify their voices on stage. Their full outfits included colourful garments called “Chitons”.</li>
